# It's a Blizzard Out There

Make your website snow.

## How to use

There are two ways you can make your pages snow. If you'd like your site
to always use the most up to date version, you can include the following
script snippet on your page.

    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://itsablizzardoutthere.com/snowfall.stable.js"></script>

The second method is to download the script from this page an include it
on your page.

## Compatability

* Firefox
* Chrome
* Opera 12+
* iOS 5+
* Android 2.3+
* IE 9+

IE 7 and 8 are compatible using [explorercanvas from Google](http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/).

## Configuration options

Well... there aren't any right now. It will draw as many snowflakes as
possible while staying at around 30 frames per second. There may be more
options in the future. If you have any specific requests, let me know in
the issues area.
